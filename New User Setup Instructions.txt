New User Setup\Copy Procedures

1. Run scripts in following order to create the initial stored proc. 
You can change the USE statement at the beginning of each script
to build the stored procs in whichever server you want them to reside. Building them in the master
DB is not a good idea. If necessary, create another db in which they will reside.
	
	usp_hexadecimal
	usp_help_revlogin
	usp_help_revserverrole
	usp_help_revdbrole

2. Running the scripts in the following order making sure to retain the output.

exec usp_help_revlogin 'username' --can be Windows or SQL based login. Outputs Create User stmt.
exec usp_help_revserverrole 'username' --Outputs server based role assignments for that user.
exec usp_help_revdbrole --Outputs DB based role assignments for that user.

3. You can now run the output as individual sql statements. These scripts can also be used to
copy all credentials to another NEW user login, however you might want to go back to the new user and
change the password through Management Studio. Also, if you are copying a sql login, remove the 'SID='
portion of the CREATE USER statement.
